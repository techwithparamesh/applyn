You are a senior SaaS UI/UX designer and frontend engineer.

I am building a SaaS product called "Applyn"
Tagline: "Your website. Now an app."

Your task is to DESIGN and IMPLEMENT a HIGH-CONVERSION SaaS HEADER
and HERO SECTION for an India-focused B2B SaaS website.

====================
PRODUCT CONTEXT
====================
Applyn converts any website URL into a mobile app (Android/iOS).
Target users are non-technical business owners, agencies, bloggers, and startups.

The design must be:
- Clean
- Trustworthy
- Modern SaaS style
- Conversion-focused
- Mobile-first

====================
HEADER REQUIREMENTS
====================
1. Left aligned logo (Applyn)
2. Minimal navigation links:
   - Home
   - Pricing
   - FAQ
3. Right side actions:
   - "Sign in" (text link)
   - Primary CTA button with text: "Create My App"
4. CTA button must:
   - Stand out clearly
   - Be rounded (pill style)
   - Use a trust-building blue gradient
5. Sticky header on scroll
6. Mobile:
   - Only logo + CTA visible
   - Hamburger menu for rest

====================

Optional trust badges:

- Made for Indian businesses

====================
TECH REQUIREMENTS
====================

- Production-quality code
- No placeholder text

====================
